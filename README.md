# HMDA Platform

## This project is a work in progress

Information contained in this repository should be considered provisional and a work in progress, and not the final implementation for the HMDA Platform, unless otherwise indicated.

## Introduction

For more information on HMDA, checkout the [About HMDA page](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/learn-more) on the CFPB website.

## The HMDA Platform

This repository contains the code for the entirety of the HMDA platform backend. This platform has been designed to accommodate the needs of the HMDA filing process by financial institutions, as well as the data management and publication needs of the HMDA data asset.

The HMDA Platform uses sbt's multi-project builds, each project representing a specific task. The platform is an Akka Cluster
application that can be deployed on a single node or as a distributed application. For more information on how Akka Cluster
is used, see the documentation [here](Documents/cluster.md)



### Java 9 SDK

The HMDA Platform runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and requires the Java 9 JDK to build and run the project. This project is currently being built and tested on [Oracle JDK 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). See [Oracle's JDK Install Overview](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) for install instructions.

The HMDA Platform should also run on JDK 8.

### Scala

The HMDA Platform is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). To build it, you will need to [download](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and [install](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) Scala 2.12.x

In addition, you'll need Scala's interactive build tool [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). Please refer to sbt's [installation instructions](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) to get started.
