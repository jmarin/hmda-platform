Welcome to the `HMDA Platform` documentation site. This website contains information for developers that want to work with the `HMDA Platform` code directly, or who would like to access its APIs.
The `HMDA Platform` described on this site is the codebase developed by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/) on behalf of the [Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)](https://www.ffiec.gov). There are currently two versions of the `HMDA Platform`, referred to in this documentation as `v1` and `v2`. 

If you are a HMDA filer and want to find more information about the HMDA Platform:
